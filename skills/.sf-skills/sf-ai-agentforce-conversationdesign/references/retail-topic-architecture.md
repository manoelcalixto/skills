## Topic Distinctness Matrix

| Topic Pair | Semantic Overlap | Confusable Utterances | Mitigation |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Order Tracking ↔ Returns & Exchanges | Medium | "Where is my return?" | Keyword detection: "return" triggers Returns topic even if phrased as tracking |
| Product Search ↔ Store Information | Low | "Do you have this in stock at the downtown store?" | Two-step flow: Product Search checks inventory, then Store Information provides address/hours |
| Account Management ↔ Order Tracking | Medium | "I need to see my orders" | Context matters: if user wants to track a specific order → Order Tracking; if browsing history → Account Management |
| Returns & Exchanges ↔ Account Management | Low | "Can I see my return history?" | Return history is part of Order History (Account Management), but active returns → Returns & Exchanges topic |

## Cross-Topic Interaction Matrix

| From Topic | To Topic | Interaction Type | Trigger | Example |
|------------|----------|------------------|---------|---------|
| Order Tracking | Returns & Exchanges | Sequential | Order received but customer wants to return | "My package arrived but the color is wrong" → Start in Order Tracking, transition to Initiate Return |
| Product Search | Store Information | Conditional | Customer wants to buy in-store | "I found the shoes I want—can I pick them up today?" → Product Search finds item, Store Information schedules pickup |
| Returns & Exchanges | Account Management | Sequential | Return processed, customer wants refund confirmation | "My return was received—where's my refund?" → Return tracking shows received, Account Management shows order history with refund status |
| Store Information | Product Search | Parallel | Customer at store wants to know if item is available | "I'm at your Chicago store—do you have size 10 Nike running shoes?" → Store Information confirms location, Product Search checks inventory |
| Account Management | Order Tracking | Sequential | Customer views order history, wants to track specific order | "I placed an order last week—where is it?" → Order History shows order, Track Order provides shipment details |

## Topic-Level Instructions

### Order Tracking Instructions
```
Before attempting to track an order, collect the order number or email address used at checkout. If the user provides a tracking number instead, use that directly with Track Order action.

For delivery address updates, verify the order hasn't already shipped. If tracking shows "Out for Delivery" or "Delivered," inform the user that address changes are no longer possible and suggest contacting the carrier.

If tracking shows no movement for 3+ business days, acknowledge the delay, provide the tracking number, and escalate to fulfillment team with case number.
```

### Product Search Instructions
```
When searching for products, start with broad keywords if the user's query is vague (e.g., "shoes" → prompt for category like running, dress, casual). Use filters like size, color, price range, and brand to narrow results.

If a product is out of stock online but available in stores (per Check Product Availability), proactively offer in-store pickup or notify-when-available options.

For product comparisons, limit to 3 items maximum. If the user wants to compare more, suggest comparing in batches or directing them to the website comparison tool.
```

### Returns & Exchanges Instructions
```
Always verify return eligibility BEFORE initiating a return. Check the return window (30 days from delivery), item condition requirements (unworn, tags attached), and restricted categories (final sale, intimate apparel, earrings).

For exchanges, confirm the desired size/color is in stock before processing. If out of stock, offer return + repurchase with a discount code to match any price changes.

Return labels are emailed within 5 minutes of initiation. If user doesn't receive it, check spam folder first, then resend via Initiate Return action.
```

### Account Management Instructions
```
For password updates, direct users to the "Forgot Password" link rather than processing in chat (security best practice).

When showing order history, default to last 12 months. If the user needs older orders, escalate to customer service with account email.

Loyalty points expire 12 months from earn date. If a user asks why points decreased, explain expiration policy and show earn/redemption history via View Loyalty Points action.
```

### Store Information Instructions
```
When providing store hours, always include today's hours first, then general weekly schedule. Flag upcoming holiday closures within the next 7 days.

For in-store pickup scheduling, confirm the item is available at the selected store BEFORE booking a pickup time. Use Check Product Availability (ACT-005) first, then Schedule In-Store Pickup (ACT-018).

If a user asks about store-specific services (tailoring, gift wrap, personal shopping), check Store Hours action which includes services. If not listed, provide store phone number for direct inquiry.
```

## Topic Architecture Validation

### Semantic Distinctness Checklist
- [✓] No two topics have >40% classification description overlap
- [✓] Each topic name clearly indicates its purpose
- [✓] Classification descriptions use user language, not technical jargon
- [✓] Ambiguous utterances have mitigation strategies (keyword detection, two-step flows)
- [✓] Cross-topic interactions are documented

### Completeness Checklist
- [✓] All actions from inventory are assigned to a topic
- [✓] Each topic has 2+ actions (no single-action topics)
- [✓] Agent-level out-of-scope is defined (5 categories)
- [✓] Topic-level instructions exist for all topics
- [✓] Utterance coverage plan includes edge cases

### Performance Checklist
- [✓] Total topics: 5 (optimal range: 3-7)
- [✓] Topic count justification: Five topics balance specificity with manageability. Combining "Order Tracking" and "Returns" would create confusion (very different intents); splitting "Product Search" into subcategories (apparel, electronics, etc.) would create routing complexity.
- [✓] No topics with >50% overlap in classification descriptions
- [✓] All topics have distinct primary intents
