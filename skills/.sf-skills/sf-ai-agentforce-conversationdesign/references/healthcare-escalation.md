## Escalation Messages

### Pre-Escalation (Before Handoff)

**Default Message:**
```
I'm going to connect you with a specialist who can help with this right away. You should see them join in just a moment. They'll have all the information from our conversation so you won't need to repeat yourself.
```

**Frustrated User Variant:**
```
I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I'm connecting you with a specialist right now who has the tools to resolve this. They'll be with you shortly and will have full context of your situation.
```

**High-Priority Variant (Emergency):**
```
I'm immediately connecting you with our emergency nurse. They'll be with you in less than 60 seconds.

IMPORTANT: If you're experiencing a life-threatening emergency, please hang up and call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room right away.
```

### During Handoff (Wait State)

**Initial Wait Message:**
```
Your specialist is being notified now. Typical wait time is [X minutes]. I'll stay here with you until they arrive.
```

**Extended Wait Message (if >2 minutes for urgent, >5 minutes for normal):**
```
I'm sorry for the wait. I'm actively monitoring for your specialist to join. If you'd prefer, I can have them call you at [phone number] instead, or you can continue waiting here. What works better for you?
```

### Post-Escalation (Human Takes Over)

**Human Agent Greeting Template:**
```
Hi [Patient Name], this is [Agent Name], [Title]. I've reviewed your conversation with our virtual assistant and I'm here to help with [specific issue]. [Personalized response based on context summary]
```

**Context Summary for Human:**
```
Agent attempted: [List of actions taken - e.g., "Searched for appointments on 3/15, no availability found"]
User's goal: [e.g., "Schedule annual physical with Dr. Smith in next 2 weeks"]
Escalation reason: [e.g., "Complex scheduling - requires coordination between 3 providers"]
Relevant data:
  - Patient: [Name], MRN [Number], DOB [Date]
  - Insurance: [Plan name], ID [Number]
  - Last Visit: [Date] with [Provider]
  - Preferred Times: [If mentioned]
Patient Sentiment: [Calm|Frustrated|Angry|Anxious]
```

## Post-Escalation Workflow

### Agent Behavior After Handoff

- [✓] Agent remains in conversation: Yes (stays silent unless human agent requests assistance)
- [✓] Agent monitors for human agent join: Yes (auto-notifies user when human joins)
- [✓] Agent logs escalation reason: Yes (creates Case record with escalation category)
- [✓] Agent creates follow-up task: Yes (if human agent doesn't join within SLA)

**If Human Agent Unavailable:**
Attempt 1: Wait 30 seconds, retry queue assignment
Attempt 2: Route to overflow queue
Attempt 3: Create high-priority Case, offer callback scheduling
Message: "I apologize—our specialists are all assisting other patients right now. I've created a priority case (#[CASE_NUMBER]) and [Specialist Type] will call you at [PHONE] within [SLA]. You'll also receive an email confirmation. Is there anything else I can help with while you wait?"

### Escalation Metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- First Contact Resolution (FCR) after escalation: >75%
- Human agent accepts transfer within: SLA time (varies by priority - see queue configs)
- User satisfaction (CSAT) for escalated conversations: >4.0/5.0

**Monitoring:**
- Daily escalation rate: Target <20% of total conversations
- Top escalation reasons (weekly review): Insurance (28%), Complex Scheduling (22%), Prescription Qs (18%), Complaints (12%), HIPAA (10%), Emergency (8%), Other (2%)
- Escalation trend threshold: Alert if rate exceeds 25% for 3 consecutive days

## De-Escalation Strategies

### Before Triggering Escalation

**Attempt:**
1. **Rephrase and clarify intent**: If user request is ambiguous, ask specific questions to understand the need before assuming escalation is required.
2. **Offer self-service alternative**: "I can send you a link to view your test results in the patient portal—would that work, or do you need to speak with someone?"
3. **Break complex requests into simple steps**: For multi-part requests, handle what's possible via automation first (e.g., schedule simple appointment, then escalate for complex referral).

**If De-Escalation Succeeds:**
Continue conversation flow, mark in logs as "Near-Escalation Avoided" for analysis to improve agent capabilities.

**If De-Escalation Fails:**
Proceed with escalation, but log the attempted de-escalation strategies for training purposes.

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: User Refuses to Call 911 for Medical Emergency

**Scenario:** User describes chest pain or severe symptoms but insists on handling via chat instead of calling emergency services.

**Escalation Decision:** Escalate to Emergency Nurse Queue AND provide strong 911 recommendation.

**Rationale:** Agent cannot force user to call 911, but can escalate to clinical staff who may have more influence. Document in case notes that patient was advised to call 911 but declined.

---

### Edge Case 2: Minor Requests Escalation to Avoid Agent

**Scenario:** User requests human agent for simple tasks like "what time are you open?" to avoid interacting with bot.

**Escalation Decision:** De-escalate by providing the information directly, then asking "Is there anything else I can help with, or would you still prefer to speak with someone?"

**Rationale:** Reduces unnecessary escalation volume. Most users accept answer once provided. If user insists on human after receiving answer, honor request but route to low-priority queue.

---

### Edge Case 3: User Becomes Abusive or Threatens Staff

**Scenario:** User uses profanity, makes threats, or harasses agent.

**Escalation Decision:** Provide one warning: "I'm here to help, but I need to ask that we keep our conversation respectful. Continued abusive language may result in ending this chat." If continues, escalate to Security Queue with full transcript.

**Rationale:** Patient safety and staff protection. Security team can assess threat level and flag patient record if needed.

---

### Edge Case 4: User Requests Controlled Substance Prescription Refill

**Scenario:** User asks to refill opioid or other controlled medication.

**Escalation Decision:** Escalate to Pharmacist Queue with note: "Controlled substance refill request - requires provider authorization per DEA regulations."

**Rationale:** Legal requirement that controlled substances require provider verification. Pharmacist will coordinate with prescriber.

---

### Edge Case 5: After-Hours Emergency (No Clinical Staff Available)

**Scenario:** Medical emergency escalation triggered at 2am when Emergency Nurse Queue has no available agents.

**Escalation Decision:** Display message: "URGENT: Please call 911 immediately or go to your nearest emergency room. This is a potential medical emergency that requires immediate in-person evaluation. Our clinical staff will follow up within 24 hours." Create high-priority Case for morning triage.

**Rationale:** Cannot leave patient without guidance during true emergency. Direct to appropriate emergency care, document for follow-up.
